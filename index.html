            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>The Akshaya Patra Foundation is an NGO in India headquartered in Bengaluru. Our organisation strives to eliminate classroom hunger by implementing the Mid-Day Meal Scheme in the government schools and government-aided schools. Alongside, Akshaya Patra also aims at countering malnutrition and supporting the right to education of socio-economically disadvantaged children.</p>
            <p>Since 2000, Akshaya Patra has been concerting all its efforts towards providing fresh and nutritious meals to children on every single school day. We are continuously leveraging technology to multiply our reach. The state-of-the-art kitchens have become a subject of study and have attracted curious visitors from around the world.</p>
            <p>Our partnership with the Government of India and various State Governments, along with the persistent support from corporates, individual donors, and well-wishers have helped us to grow from serving just 1,500 children in 5 schools in 2000 to serving 1.8 million children.</p>
            <p>Today, Akshaya Patra is the world’s largest (not-for-profit run) Mid-Day Meal Programme serving wholesome food every school day to over 1.8 million children from 19,039 schools across 12 states & 2 Union territories of India.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Raising funds for the under-privileged children to understand what is refraining students from joining schools on time.</h3>
            <p>
                I am raising funds for the under-privileged children to understand their state of mind and examining 
                the whole set of reasons like what is refraining them from joining schools on time. Due to lack of interest in education, the students prefer to invest their time in doing the side hustle activities basically earning for the family due to parental pressure and several other reasons. Moreover, they are being suffered from various issues like low self-esteem, financial problems, high levels of stress and worry, various forms of abuse, drug abuse, violence, decision-making, don’t foresee any use of education and other family problems. This is important to me because I feel early childhood education is not only about learning basic skills, it is so much more than that as it involves a time when children learn critical social and emotional skills and a partnership is formed between the child, their parents and the teacher. When this is done successfully, it lays the groundwork for it to continue throughout the child’s education and will ultimately help this nation grow.

        <!-- ROLE OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION INFO -->

        <section class="background">
            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Role of Elementary Education in the National Development</h1>
               <p style="padding: 30px;">
                Education is one of the basic needs for human development and going to school
                regularly is crucially important for advancement of a student’s academic and social
                skills (Ghosh et.al. 2017). It is one of the primary agents of transformation towards
                development. It is the series of activities which may either improve the immediate
                living conditions or increase the potential for future living. It may play an important
                role in bringing tangible benefits by developing the skills of the people. It may
                expand livelihood opportunities and increase earning potential and thus help in
                tackling the problem of poverty at large. The major role that education has been
                able to play is regarding knowledge inculcation and skill improvement of the
                person. Amartya Sen’s argued that providing primary education, we can bring for
                faster development in India.Education is the principal factor in the development and growth of a child
                in preparing them to be a responsible and capable citizen. It is the most important
                asset we have because knowledge is the type of wealth that we will never lose no
                matter what we do, and the more we share it the more it increases. 
                </p>

                <p style="padding: 30px;">
                Elementary education is regarded as the foundation on which learning, growth and development
                of the individuals takes place. It is the primary objective of elementary schools to
                create the foundation on which growth and development of the individuals takes
                place. However, basic knowledge starts with elementary education without it none
                of our dreams will be possible. Elementary education is like the first and foremost
                phase, we take in life; we will never be able to run if we don’t learn how to walk. It
                plays a very critical role in ones educational life. Elementary education has certain
                targeted roles to play in a child’s life such as enabling children to learn reading,
                writing, arithmetic, and creativity along with character building, critical thinking,
                logical judgement, communication and socialization skills, behavioural, social,
                cultural, cognitive, physical and emotional development. 
                </p>
                <p  style="padding: 30px;">
                Elementary education helps pupil to build challenging and competitive environment among themselves
                that help to create competition and motivate them to work harder, better, and 
                creatively bringing out the best out of themselves. The key objective of the
                elementary education is to teach children to think analytically, to achieve high
                living standards, to face the challenges posed by technological development and
                advancement of citizenship and basic values. It provides safe and positive
                environment where effective learning can take place. Primary education aimed to
                provide an opportunity to have a team that is steady to interact. Elementary
                education enables students to make friends who facilitate acquisition and
                development of communication skills. It is the phase where students may be
                influenced positively or negatively. The future of a child is totally dependent on the
                elementary education. It would boost kids’ self-confidence and offer child the skills
                they need for the long success in this competitive world. The growth is parallel to
                the future of our country, reflected through quality of the present education system.
                A school must stimulate curiosity in the young, impressionable minds and equip
                them with tools to be better human beings.
                </p>
                <p style="padding: 30px;">
                    Earlier the education system was based on 10+2 pattern but now after
                    National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 came into force and it has been changed to
                    5+3+3+4 structure. This policy has been revised after 34 years. In NEP focus is
                    given on early childhood as it is the foundation age. Attaining foundational literacy
                    and numeracy for all children will thus become an urgent national mission, with
                    immediate measures to be taken on many fronts and with clear goals that will be
                    attained in the short term (including that every student will attain foundational
                    literacy and numeracy by Grade 3). The highest priority of the education system
                    will be to achieve universal foundational literacy and numeracy in primary school
                    by 2025 (NEP 2020). NEP has taken initiatives to bring students to the schools. The
                    first is to provide effective and sufficient infrastructure so that all students have
                    access to safe and engaging school education at all levels from pre-primary school
                    to Grade 12. Besides providing regular trained teachers at each stage, special care
                    shall be taken to ensure that no school remains deficient on infrastructure support.
                    The second is to achieve universal participation in school by carefully tracking
                    students, as well as their learning levels, to ensure that they 
                    <br>
                    (a) are enrolled in and
                    attending school, and 
                    <br>
                    (b) have suitable opportunities to catch up and re-enter school
                    in case they have fallen behind or dropped out.

It is a comprehensive term which includes school buildings, playgrounds, civic amenities, libraries, laboratories, drinking water, toilet facilities teaching learning material etc. Without adequate infrastructural 
                    facilities the students will not feel happy and comfortable to come to school.

                    Shortage of Teachers: Teachers are the torch bearers in the life of students. If they will not be in sufficient number in the school, then teaching learning will be hampered brutally. The shortage of teachers has been detrimental upon education,
                     learning, growth and development of the students and school functioning.

                    Low Attendance of Students: Low attendance of students in school is due to many factors. Students are absent from school, but the cause of absence is both inside and outside the school. It can also be classified as voluntary i.e., when student may not wish to attend the school and involuntary includes when they miss school due to their family situations or due to unavoidable circumstances (Birioukov 2017). 
                    It means that students are not coming regularly to school which hampers their sequence of knowledge.
